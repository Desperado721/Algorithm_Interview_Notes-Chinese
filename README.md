<!--
Algorithm/deep learning/machine learning interview problem sorting, the idea originally came from this [warehouse] (https://github.com/elviswf/DeepLearningBookQA_cn).
 - The warehouse has compiled some common problems in "Flower Book" and "Deep Learning". Some of the partial theoretical questions are not included. If necessary, you can browse the original warehouse.

In addition, it includes all the problems in machine learning/deep learning that I have seen.
In addition to the DL/ML related, other computer knowledge related to the algorithmic post will be recorded.
However, it will not include issues related to posts such as front-end/test/JAVA/Android.

Welcome to share the questions you encountered during the interview!
---
- You can directly use the question you are experiencing as the issue title and then share your answer or other reference material.
- I will often modify the structure of the document. If there is a link in the text, please let me know!
